# DeepFakeOmeter

<img src="static/images/deepfakeometer2.png" alt="logo" width="150"/>

This repository is a python library, which incorperates existing deepfake detection method into an unified framework.

Structure of the folder:

```
 --- deepfakeOmeter
  |- log     
  |- py_utils  
  |- result
  |- static
  |- templates
  |- tmp   

 ```
log: the txt file records the used ports

py_utils: the vidoe pre-processing files

result: the detection result

static: the css files and the images

templates: the html files

tmp: the folder where the submitted video is saved

## Instruction

This website including four components.

+ Monitor the submission from the website.

The demo_video.py will save the submitted video and detection methods under the tmp folder named by its submission email and submission time. You can directly upload the video or upload an url.
+ Monitor the submission video.

Once the video has been completely saved, the  scanVideo.py will detect the signal and analysis the submission video with its selected methods.
+ Send the E-mail.

When finish analysising the video, we will send an e-mail to te user to inform him to download the result in 5 days.
+ Clean ports.

Since we will open a port for each submission, we will automatically close the ports opened 5 days ago.


## Quick Start

1. Set up the environment

+ Set up the environment of the website
```
pip install requirement.txt
```
+ Set up the environment of the dokcer images
```
docker build -t capsulenet ./dockerfile/CapsuleNet/
docker build -t classnseg ./dockerfile/ClassNSeg/
docker build -t cnndetection ./dockerfile/CNNDetetion/
docker build -t dspfwa ./dockerfile/DSPFWA/
docker build -t fwa ./dockerfile/FWA/
docker build -t mesonet ./dockerfile/MesoNet/
docker build -t selim ./dockerfile/SelimSefer/
docker build -t upconv ./dockerfile/Upconv/
docker build -t va ./dockerfile/VA/
docker build -t wm ./dockerfile/WM/
docker build -t xception ./dockerfile/XceptionNet/
```

2. Change some information

+ Change the email information in scanEmail.py

https://github.com/yuezunli/deepfake-o-meter/blob/zc/deepfakeOmeter/scanEmail.py#L44-L47
+ Change the local direction of the deepforensics in scanVideo.py

https://github.com/yuezunli/deepfake-o-meter/blob/zc/deepfakeOmeter/scanVideo.py#L30

+ Make sure environment names are consistent with the names in scanVideo.py.

https://github.com/yuezunli/deepfake-o-meter/blob/zc/deepfakeOmeter/scanVideo.py#L15-L27

3. Run the four python files

First, you should set the port of the website in demo_video.py.

https://github.com/yuezunli/deepfake-o-meter/blob/zc/deepfakeOmeter/demo_video.py#L116

Then, run the following four python files.
```
python demo_video.py
python scanVideo.py
python scanEmail.py
python scanPort.py
```
And you can visit the website by  ip:port
